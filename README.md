# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two user-provided numbers. It's a great little tool for quick calculations with a sprinkle of fun! 😎

## 🚀 Features
- **Addition** (`+`) - Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction** (`-`) - Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication** (`*`) - Multiplies the two numbers.
- **Division** (`/`) - Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero! �).

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers (supports decimals! ✨).
2. It performs the four basic arithmetic operations.
3. Displays the results in a clean, formatted output.

## ⚠️ Note
- This calculator assumes the user **does not divide by zero**—no error handling is included (yet!).
- For best results, enter valid numerical inputs.

## 📋 Example Usage
```plaintext
Enter the first number: 10.5  
Enter the second number: 2  

Results of your two numbers:  
Sum: 12.5  
Difference: 8.5  
Product: 21.0  
Quotient: 5.25  
```

## 🎯 Why Use This?
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Great for beginners learning Python basics.
- Fun emojis make math a little more exciting! 🥳

## 🔧 Future Improvements
- Add error handling (e.g., division by zero, non-numeric inputs).
- Extend with more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.).
- Add a loop for continuous calculations.

Happy calculating! 💻✨  
*Made with Python and a dash of fun.* 😊
